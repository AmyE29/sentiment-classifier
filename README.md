# sentiment-classifier

I chose a data set that has reviews of clothing purchases from various e-commerce sites.  The reviews are bases on a 1 to 5 star rating (1 being the worst, 5 being the best) and the comments reflect what the purchaser liked or didn't like about their item.

I distributed my sentiments based on the star ratings 4 or 5 starts got a positive sentiment, 3 got a neutral, and 2 or 1 was a negative.

The preprocessing work was done using Keras and Tensorflow taking a One-Hot Vector approach.
